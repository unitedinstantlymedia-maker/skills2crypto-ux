Implement a feature that lets the user create a challenge link to invite a specific friend to a match, as an alternative to the normal random matchmaking.

Challenge Link Generation:

After the user selects the game, network/asset, and stake amount, there should be TWO buttons:

One to start searching for a random opponent (as now).

One to create a challenge link for a friend ("Challenge Friend" or "Create Link").

If the user clicks the “Create Link” button, prompt them with an input field to enter their name or nickname (e.g., “Enter your name or nickname”).

Once entered, generate a unique challenge link (can be a URL with parameters, or any challenge object).

Store the nickname in localStorage, so next time it is auto-filled.

Accepting a Challenge:

When the recipient opens the challenge link, they should see on the screen:

“Challenge from [nickname]” (using the nickname that was entered by the challenger).

There should be a button “Accept Challenge”.

If the recipient has not connected their wallet yet, show a modal or section to connect or paste their wallet address before accepting. There must be a “Save” button and then a button to continue.

If the wallet is already connected, pressing “Accept Challenge” immediately freezes the stake and starts the game.

Stake Logic:

When a user sends a challenge link, only their own stake is locked at this step (after pressing the button).

When the recipient presses “Accept Challenge”, their stake is locked automatically and the match begins.

The recipient should not see or have to press any extra “Lock stake” buttons — just “Accept Challenge” (if wallet is connected) or “Save Wallet” and then “Accept Challenge” (if not).

User Experience:

The user never has to register or provide more info than their nickname.

Everything happens in a single flow, without unnecessary extra screens or reloads.

If possible, make sure that the “nickname” is saved for future challenges.

Short version for Replit’s working prompt:

Add “Challenge Friend” flow:

On the asset/stake selection screen, add two buttons: “Find Match” (random) and “Challenge Friend” (create a link).

When clicking “Challenge Friend”, prompt for nickname, generate a unique link including the nickname, and save it in localStorage.

When recipient opens the link, show “Challenge from [nickname]” and an “Accept Challenge” button.

If wallet is not connected, prompt for wallet and then proceed.

Lock stakes automatically on each side at the right time (sender on create, recipient on accept).

No registration. Flow must be as simple and direct as possible.
