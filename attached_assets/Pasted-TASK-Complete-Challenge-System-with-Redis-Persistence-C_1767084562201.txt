TASK: Complete Challenge System with Redis Persistence

CURRENT STATE:
- Challenge system partially implemented with mock data
- Redis is already connected and working (see server/redis.ts)
- Challenge routes exist in server/routes.ts but need improvement
- Challenges are stored in Redis with 1-hour TTL
- No cleanup mechanism for expired challenges
- Status tracking is basic (pending/accepted only)

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. ADD CHALLENGE STATUS ENUM
Create proper status tracking in shared/schema.ts:
- Define ChallengeStatus enum: "pending" | "accepted" | "expired" | "cancelled" | "completed"
- Add type exports for challenge data structure

2. IMPROVE REDIS STORAGE STRUCTURE
In server/routes.ts, enhance challenge data storage:
- Add expiresAt timestamp
- Add accepterName field
- Add completedAt timestamp (when match finishes)
- Store challenger's socketId for notifications

3. IMPLEMENT EXPIRATION CLEANUP
Create server/matchmaking/challengeCleanup.ts:
- Background job that runs every 5 minutes
- Scans Redis for expired challenges (createdAt + 3600000 < Date.now())
- Updates status to "expired" instead of deleting
- Keeps expired challenges for 24 hours for history

4. ADD CHALLENGE CANCELLATION
In server/routes.ts:
- POST /api/cancel-challenge endpoint
- Validates challengerId matches requester
- Updates status to "cancelled"
- Notifies any connected accepter

5. ADD CHALLENGE HISTORY TRACKING
- Store all challenge state changes in Redis
- Format: challenge:{id}:history array with timestamp + status + action
- Useful for debugging and analytics

6. ENHANCE SOCKET.IO NOTIFICATIONS
In server/socket.ts:
- Emit "challenge-expired" when challenge expires
- Emit "challenge-cancelled" when creator cancels
- Store challenger socketId in challenge data for notifications

7. ADD CHALLENGE LIST ENDPOINT
- GET /api/challenges/:userId - Returns all challenges for a user
- Filters by status (pending, accepted, expired, cancelled)
- Useful for future "My Challenges" UI

FILES TO MODIFY:
- shared/schema.ts (add types/enums)
- server/routes.ts (enhance endpoints)
- server/matchmaking/challengeCleanup.ts (NEW FILE - cleanup job)
- server/socket.ts (add notifications)
- server/index.ts (start cleanup job on server boot)

TESTING CHECKLIST:
✅ Challenge expires after 1 hour
✅ Expired challenges move to "expired" status
✅ Creator can cancel pending challenge
✅ Cleanup job runs every 5 minutes
✅ Old challenges are purged after 24 hours
✅ Status transitions are logged in history

Please implement all changes with complete code, no ellipsis.
